Every cyclist and stage of the Tour de France (up to including 2025) in four CSV files.

If you use `pandas`, just get the data via:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Men's Tour de France data
df_men_riders = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/men/TDF_Riders_History.csv")
df_men_stages = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/men/TDF_Stages_History.csv")

# Women's Tour de France data
df_women_riders = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/women/TDFF_Riders_History.csv")
df_women_stages = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/women/TDFF_Stages_History.csv")
```

If you use `R` instead of `python`, you can run:

```R
library(readr)

# Men's Tour de France data
df_men_riders <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/men/TDF_Riders_History.csv")
df_men_stages <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/men/TDF_Stages_History.csv")

# Women's Tour de France data
df_women_riders <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/women/TDFF_Riders_History.csv")
df_women_stages <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomascamminady/LeTourDataSet/master/data/women/TDFF_Stages_History.csv")
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Download latest data (2025 men's and 2024 women's included)
